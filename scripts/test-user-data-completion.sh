    echo "========================================="

    echo "‚úÖ BEFORE (Problem):"
    echo "   - Terraform considers EC2 instance 'ready' immediately after creation"
    echo "   - User data script runs in background (can take 5-10 minutes)"
    echo "   - Subsequent resources may fail if they depend on K3s being ready"
    echo "   - Manual SSH/SSM checks required to verify installation"
    echo ""
    echo "‚úÖ AFTER (Solution):"
    echo "   - Terraform waits for K3s installation to complete"
    echo "   - null_resource with remote-exec provisioner blocks until ready"
    echo "   - Verifies completion marker: /var/log/k3s-install-complete"
    echo "   - Tests K3s service status and kubectl connectivity"
    echo "   - Guarantees K3s is operational before marking deployment complete"
    echo ""
    echo "üîß Implementation Details:"
    echo "   - Uses SSH connection with private key from GitHub secrets"
    echo "   - Polls for completion marker every 30 seconds"
    echo "   - 10-minute timeout prevents infinite waiting"
    echo "   - Triggers re-provisioning if instance changes"
