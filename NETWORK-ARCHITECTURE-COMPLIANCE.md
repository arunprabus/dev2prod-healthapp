# Network Architecture Compliance Report

## âœ… Architecture Compliance Status: **COMPLIANT**

Your infrastructure now meets the target network architecture requirements from the GitHub repository.

## Network Design Overview

### Environment Isolation
- **Dev Environment**: `10.0.0.0/16` (Lower Environment)
- **Test Environment**: `10.2.0.0/16` (Separate Environment) 
- **Prod Environment**: `10.1.0.0/16` (Higher Environment)
- **Monitoring Environment**: `10.3.0.0/16` (Cross-environment monitoring)

### Subnet Architecture (Per Environment)
- **Public Subnets**: Multi-AZ deployment for load balancers and NAT gateways
- **Private Subnets**: Multi-AZ deployment for EKS nodes and RDS instances
- **Database Subnets**: Isolated within private subnet ranges

### Key Components Implemented

#### âœ… Network Infrastructure
- [x] Isolated VPCs per environment
- [x] Multi-AZ public and private subnets
- [x] Internet Gateway for public subnet access
- [x] NAT Gateways for private subnet internet access
- [x] Proper route table configurations

#### âœ… Security
- [x] Private subnets for EKS clusters
- [x] Private subnets for RDS databases
- [x] Security groups with least privilege access
- [x] Network ACLs (default AWS settings)

#### âœ… Connectivity
- [x] VPC Peering between monitoring and other environments
- [x] Cross-environment monitoring capability
- [x] Proper DNS resolution across VPCs

#### âœ… High Availability
- [x] Multi-AZ deployment across ap-south-1a, ap-south-1b, ap-south-1c
- [x] Redundant NAT Gateways per AZ
- [x] EKS node groups distributed across AZs

## Fixed Issues

### ðŸ”§ CIDR Conflicts Resolved
- **Before**: Dev and Test both used `10.0.0.0/16` (conflict)
- **After**: 
  - Dev: `10.0.0.0/16`
  - Test: `10.2.0.0/16` 
  - Prod: `10.1.0.0/16`
  - Monitoring: `10.3.0.0/16`

### ðŸ”§ Configuration Cleanup
- Removed duplicate configuration blocks in prod.tfvars
- Standardized subnet naming conventions
- Added proper VPC name references for peering

## Deployment Verification

To verify the architecture is properly deployed:

```bash
# Deploy each environment
terraform apply -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"
terraform apply -var-file="environments/test.tfvars" 
terraform apply -var-file="environments/prod.tfvars"
terraform apply -var-file="environments/monitoring.tfvars"
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Environment Isolation**: Each environment is completely isolated
2. **Scalability**: Can independently scale each environment
3. **Security**: Private subnets protect critical resources
4. **Monitoring**: Centralized monitoring with cross-VPC connectivity
5. **Cost Optimization**: Right-sized instances per environment
6. **High Availability**: Multi-AZ deployment ensures resilience

## Next Steps

1. Deploy environments in order: dev â†’ test â†’ prod â†’ monitoring
2. Verify VPC peering connections are established
3. Test cross-environment monitoring connectivity
4. Validate security group rules are working correctly
