# 📋 **Changelog - GitHub Runner Improvements**

## **Latest Updates (Current Session)**

### **🔧 GitHub Runner Service Fixes**
- **Fixed service startup issues** in `user_data.sh`
- **Added fallback startup method** if systemd service fails
- **Enhanced permissions** for ubuntu user to manage services
- **Added process verification** to ensure Runner.Listener is active

### **🔍 Runner Connectivity Testing**
- **Created** `test-runner-connectivity.yml` workflow
- **Tests**: Network connectivity, SSH access, K3s cluster access
- **Validates**: Runner can communicate with K3s nodes

### **💊 Runner Health Monitoring**
- **Added health monitor script** (`monitor-runner.sh`) - runs every 5 minutes
- **Auto-restart capability** if runner goes offline
- **GitHub API connectivity checks**
- **Manual restart script** (`restart-runner.sh`)

### **🧹 GitHub Runner Cleanup System**
- **Created** `cleanup-github-runners.yml` workflow for manual cleanup
- **Enhanced user_data.sh** with aggressive cleanup before registration
- **Removes ALL old runners** for network tier before creating new ones
- **Prevents duplicate runners** in GitHub interface

### **🏷️ Simplified Runner Naming & Labels**
- **Before**: `awsrunner-lower-devtest-xxx` with 8+ labels
- **After**: `github-runner-lower-xxx` with single `github-runner-{network_tier}` label
- **Updated all scripts** to use new naming convention
- **Cleaner GitHub runner interface**

### **📚 Documentation Updates**
- **Updated README** with correct naming conventions
- **Fixed resource naming patterns** to match actual infrastructure
- **Updated GitHub runner configuration table**

## **Files Modified:**
1. `infra/modules/github-runner/user_data.sh` - Service fixes, health monitoring, cleanup
2. `.github/workflows/test-runner-connectivity.yml` - New connectivity test
3. `.github/workflows/cleanup-github-runners.yml` - New cleanup workflow
4. `README.md` - Updated naming conventions and documentation

## **Key Benefits Achieved:**
- ✅ **Reliable Runner Startup** - Multiple fallback methods
- ✅ **Self-Healing** - Automatic health monitoring and restart
- ✅ **Clean Interface** - No duplicate runners, simple labels
- ✅ **Easy Testing** - Dedicated connectivity test workflow
- ✅ **Manual Control** - Cleanup workflow for maintenance

## **Usage Examples:**

### **Workflow Targeting:**
```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, github-runner-lower]    # For dev/test
    runs-on: [self-hosted, github-runner-higher]   # For production
    runs-on: [self-hosted, github-runner-monitoring] # For monitoring
```

### **Manual Operations:**
```bash
# Test runner connectivity
Actions → Test Runner Connectivity → Select environment → Run

# Clean up duplicate runners
Actions → Cleanup GitHub Runners → Select network tier → Run

# SSH to runner for debugging
ssh -i ~/.ssh/k3s-key ubuntu@<runner-ip>
/home/ubuntu/debug-runner.sh
```

## **Next Steps:**
- Monitor runner health via automated monitoring
- Use simplified labels in workflow targeting
- Leverage cleanup workflow for maintenance
- Test connectivity before deployments
